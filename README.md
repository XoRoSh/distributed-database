# Distributed database 
This project introduced me distributed databases and how they work. 
I learned about consistent hashing and tried to implement something similar with my team.
We learned 


## System overview 
We had 4 servers to work with. One of them had to be proxy and db at the same time. **SQLite** is handling the requests on the db servers.
We implemented : 
- proxy caching 
- monitoring
- self-healing of db servers
- introduction of a new node

To read more in deatails about any of these see **REPORT**
